# NavX

## Introduction

- The Goal is to help developers understand github Repositories easily.
- Tells you about the functionality implemented in GitHub Repository.
- Allows you to perform Search on GitHub repositories in order to find code that have implemented
  particular Functionality.
- Summary of every file and directory in the repository is generated.
- Saves time and simplifies understanding github repositories

## Key Features

### Semantic Code Search

Navigate through repositories based on functionality rather than just keywords. The semantic search capability understands the context and purpose of code, making it easier to find specific implementations and features.

### Functionality-Based Exploration

Find and analyze code implementations based on their actual functionality. This feature helps developers quickly locate specific features or patterns within a repository, saving valuable development time.

### Code Understanding Tools

- **File Summaries**: Get concise summaries of individual code files
- **Directory Overview**: Understand the structure and purpose of different directories
- **Contextual Analysis**: View code in the context of its broader functionality

## Purpose

This tool addresses common challenges in code exploration and understanding by:

- Simplifying the process of finding specific code implementations
- Providing clear, contextual summaries of code structure
- Making large codebases more accessible and understandable
- Reducing the time needed to comprehend new codebases

## Contributing

The project is open source and welcomes contributions. Follow project updates on Twitter or star the repository on GitHub to stay informed about new features and improvements.
