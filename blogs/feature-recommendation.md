Let's plan a feature-based recommendation system for your GitHub semantic search. Here's how we can break it down for an MVP:

1. Initial Feature Detection Strategy

- Focus on detecting 3-4 core features first, like:
  - Authentication
  - Database Operations
  - API Routes
  - Configuration Management

2. Pattern Recognition Rules

- Look for key indicators in code:
  - File names (auth.js, db.js, routes.js)
  - Common function patterns (login, register, authenticate)
  - Import statements (express, passport, mongoose)
  - Configuration objects
  - API endpoint definitions

3. Feature Mapping Process

- Create a simple feature detection system:
  - When code matches certain patterns â†’ Tag it with feature labels
  - Map related code files to specific features
  - Track which parts of code implement each feature

4. Recommendation Flow
   When user views a repository:

- Scan for implemented features
- Identify how each feature is implemented
- Generate specific "How to" questions based on implementations
- Prioritize recommendations based on feature complexity/importance

5. MVP Scope
   Start with detecting:

- Authentication methods (JWT/Session/OAuth)
- Database connections & operations
- API endpoint structures
- Error handling patterns

Would you like to:

1. Focus on specific programming languages/frameworks first?
2. Start with certain features that are most important?
3. Define what patterns we should look for first?

This will help us create a more detailed implementation plan.
